# Legal

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a contract between you and the Carolina Ignites Authors. They govern your use of our provided sites, services, mobile apps, products, and content (“Services”).  

By using our services, you agree to these Terms. If you don’t agree to any of the Terms, you can’t use our products.

We can change these Terms at any time. We keep a historical record of all changes to our Terms on GitHub. If there's a big change, we’ll let you know before it takes effect. Usage of our services after the date of change means that you agree to the updated terms.

## Content Rights
You own the rights to the content you create and save with the [IgniteEditor](https://editor.carolinaignites.org) and ArcadeFrame.

However, by using our services, you grant us a license to host your content on our servers, and that we may use your content to promote our services. This is an at will license, please contact us if you wish to remove your content from our services.

Since this is _your_ content, you assume all risks associated with it, including copyright and the laws in your area. We will comply with App Stores, Governments and Copyright holders to remove your content if it is deemed offensive or illegal.

We can remove any content that you create from our servers for any reason.

## Bugs, Security, and Feedback
We ask that you file all bugs and security either directly through email for sensitive cases, or through our [Github issues](http://github.com/CarolinaIgnites/ArcadeFrame/issues) page. In order to report a game, please use the report functionality on the game page, or email us directly.

## Usage of our Services
You agree not to exploit our servers or app. You agree not to aggressively crawl our service, interfere or disrupt the usage of others, or engage in unauthorized usage of our api. If you DO want to script, pentest, or hack- contact us through email. We think that's cool, and maybe we can work something out.

## Paid distribution of Apps
You cannot charge in the redistribution of games based on our platform. We run this project for free, so if you're making money off of something we're doing for educational purposes- then we're not cool with that. Please contact us if you feel strongly about this clause and maybe we can work something out. Since you own the content you make, please feel free to take it and create your venture away from our platform. All our code is generously licensed and open source, but our servers won't fund your hustle.

## Disclaimer of warranty
This is a free app! The service is provided as is. Use it at your own risk or discretion. We have no guarantees of it even working, or of it being "un-hackable".

## Limitation of Liability.
We won’t be liable to you for any damages that arise from your use of our Services. This includes if we are hacked or unavailable. Importantly, it also includes if our services are exploited to harm you. This includes all types of damages (indirect, incidental, consequential, special or exemplary). And it includes all kinds of legal claims, such as breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort, or any other loss.

## Severability
Terms don't always hold up in court, so if a provision is found invalid or lacking, you agree that the court should try to understand our intentions as reflected by the provision, and that the other terms of the this agreement should still be respected.  

## Privacy
You agree to the privacy section listed in this app.
