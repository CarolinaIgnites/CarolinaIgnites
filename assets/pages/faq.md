# Frequently Asked Questions

Here's a collection of the most frequent questions we receive and some things you can address

## What is this
This app is a place to try out some of the nicer games made through the [Carolina Ignites Editor](https://editor.carolinaignites.org), and a way to test out your own games on a mobile.

## I don't see any/ can't find of the games that I made.
The games in popular are edited and hand picked by our team. This way we can ensure high quality content ith in the app. To get your game in the app, scan the QR code on the editor page with your phone, and favourite the game.  We're sure your game is spectacular :), we just don't want to overload the system.

## The game I made doesn't work.
We're sorry to hear that. If the game works in the editor but not on the app, please let us know. A few features o not work in the app- like key presses and moving objects (but maybe we'll get that fixed).

## One of my games disappeared.
You might have unfavourited it. Or, if the game was reported, and we agreed with the report, we may have removed it from our servers.

## This app takes up too much space
!! We're a little surprised. Our testing shows that it has a relatively small imprint. One thing that could be causing problems is if you have a lot of favourite games. Everytime you favourite a game, we save it to your device for offline play. Try unfavouriting some things, and reach out to us if that doesn't work.

## Thanks
Aw. Thank you too.
